// Apple Pay Tracker //
- MAIN THEME: Tracking your timely expenses (weekly, biweekly, monthly, year) and providing advice related to your spending.
- DELIVERABLES:
- To acquire information, use apple shortcuts/banking statements
- Set monthly budgets (categories based on different domains), spending preferences
- Tracks spending for each domain (food, amusement, job, etc.)
- LATER: FINANCIAL WRAPPED --> Shows yearly review, set new year financial goals
- LATER: Investment accounts --> Track your investments
- LATER: Analyze what you are spending and see what is and isn't working (tinder style)
- BLURB:
- I would like to create a financial tracking app that allows for apple payments/expenses to be tracked weekly, biweekly, monthly and yearly. First, the app should inquire about the user, their spending habits and any pertinent details (employed, student, dependacies, budget, etc.?). For weekly/biweekly payments, to acquire the data, everytime you use apple pay, an apple shortcut will prompt you to type in the payment type and cost, and that data will be consolidated on a file. For monthly/yearly reviews, you can insert the pdf (or any type) document of your bank statement. With the data acquired, it will provide insight (verbal and graphical) on where the user's money is being divested (categories: fun, food, savings, etc.). Once we have this backbone, there are other deliverables we would like to implement. Please help me achieve the following in steps?
