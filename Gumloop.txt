// GUMLOOP TUTORIAL //
AGENTS VS. FLOWS:
1. Def FLOW: Think of flows as assembly lines. You define every step, and the flow executes them in order/
2. Def AGENTS: Instead of following a fixed path, you give them a goal and a set of tools—and they figure out how to accomplish that goal.

Defining your own agent:
1. Has access to tools (all types of platforms) 
2. Instructions - Guidelines for how to use those tools and what to prioritize 
(How it should behave? What is it capable of?)
3. Feed gumloop flows

FLOW OF STEPS:
1. Instructions to set up the apple shortcuts (for the weekly/biweekly feature)
2.
